# 2019-A-Pseudo-Random-Bit-Generator-based-on-Chaotic-Map
This paper presents a new pseudo random bit generator based on a modified Gingerbreadman chaotic system, The new model has been well studied to avoid fixed and peri- odic points. We have verified that the system’s Lyapunov exponent is positive, which means the system is a chaotic one.
