# 2019-A-Pseudo-Random-Bit-Generator-based-on-Chaotic-Map
This paper presents a new pseudo random bit generator
based on a modified Gingerbreadman chaotic system, The
new model has been well studied to avoid fixed and peri-
odic points. We have verified that the system’s Lyapunov
exponent is positive, which means the system is a chaotic
one. The randomness of the bits generated by the pro-
posed generator is successfully tested by the NIST. We
notice that during the execution of the algorithm, the
password changes automatically after a number of itera-
tions
